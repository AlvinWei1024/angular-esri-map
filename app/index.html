          <h1>Zen of Directives and Maps</h1>
          <p>If you've read this far, you will have noticed that these are very, very simple
            directives. For example - there is no way to apply styles to the feature layers, nor
            is there support for any of the 20+ other layers supported by the Esri Javascript API. This was not and oversight, it was by design. </p>
            <p>We feel that the value of directives (or web components for that matter) is to 
              package up complex components, exposing a limited, simple declarative interface
              as html-elements &amp; attributes. Attempting to encapsulate all the layers, renderers, symbols and events of the JS API in a set of directives would simply add more bulk to the javascript, and create another complex api to learn and support. 
            </p>
            <h2>Roll Your Own Directives</h2>
            <p>We believe that you will have the best success integrating maps with 
              your angular applications if you build directives that focus on your problem domain.
            </p>
            <p>For example - suppose you are building an application for a local government. There is a very good chance that you would be integrating a few standard types of maps. Using the examples provided in this repo you could create directives like...</p>
            <pre><code>
&lt;parcel-map pin=&quot;ABC123&quot;&gt;&lt;/parcel-map&gt;
&lt;lot-layout-map lot=&quot;93920-A-23&quot;&gt;&lt;/lot-layout-map&gt;
&lt;workorder-map order=&quot;10-31-14-002&quot;&gt;&lt;/workorder-map&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>These directives could be easily integrated into any views in the over-arching application, or even shared across a suite of applications. 
            </p>

            <h2>Some thoughts on Angular...</h2>
            <p>At Esri we use a number of differnt javascript application frameworks, including Angular. While we find that using Angular can lead to huge productivity increases, and massively streamlined code - it is worth noting that Angular is a silver bullet for all types of web applications.
            </p>
            <p>Where we have seen the greatest benefit is in situations where the majority of the application functionality is "forms-over-data", with a few maps added in. Similarly, when we have tried to use Angular on single-page, full-screen mapping applications, we have found ourselves working against the framework. 
            </p>
            <p>So, as the old saying goes <em>use the right tool for the job!</em></p>
